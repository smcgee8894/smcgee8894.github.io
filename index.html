<div class="flex-container-outer" style="margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">
  <div class="flex-item-left70">
    <p class="subsub">Majoring in mechanical engineering with a minor in electrical engineering has given me the opportunity to design, analyze, and troubleshoot both mechanical
    and electrical systems. In particular, I have a breadth of experience performing analysis and simulation using SOLIDWORKS and MATLAB/Simulink. I am skilled at programming
    in MATLAB, C/C++, and Python. I also have experience working with control systems in S- and Z-domains, including lead and lag compensators, PID controllers, state space
    representation, and linear quadratic regulators/estimators.</p>
    <p class="subsub">My determination, analytical mindset, and passion for learning will make me a valuable addition to any team. If you have any questions for me, please
    feel free to reach out to me by <a href="mailto: smcgee8894@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a> or via my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-mcgee-55b00026/" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a>. Thank you very much for your time.</p>

      <h3>Senior Capstone Project</h3>
      <p class="subsub"><b>Project objectives: </b>Design a fixture to interface between a spherical air bearing and a satellite undergoing testing. The fixture must allow the combined center of
      mass (COM) of the fixture, the bearing, and the satellite to be precisely colocated with the bearing's center of rotation (COR), including satellites of various form factors.</p>
      <p class="subsub"><b>Final design: </b>Our fixture uses satellite mounting brackets affixed to a system of movable carriages to change the satellite's position relative to the
      air bearing. This permits the satellite's COM to be aligned with the bearing COR along two axes, while the repositioning of two weights allows alignment along the vertical axis.
      The fixture is outfitted with sensors which identify the assembly's COM location, a microcontroller which computes the satellite and weight positions required to achieve colocation,
      and motors which drive the translation of the carriages and weights to the appropriate locations.</p>
      <p class="subsub"><b>Project outcomes: </b>While the project is ongoing, current prototypes inspire confidence in the current design.</p>

      <p class="subsub"><b>Project outcomes: </b>The resulting 2D temperature distribution was displayed as a surface plot (shown right), while line plots were used to display the temperature
      distribution along each external edge of the geometry. The generated surface plot qualitatively matches the verification plot provided by my instructor, and the calculated net heat flow
      out of the geometry differs from the expected value by about (5⨯10^-18) percent.</p>

    <p class="subsub"><b>Project objectives: </b>Design and carry out a scientific experiment using the equipment available in NAU's thermal fluids laboratory.</p>
    <p class="subsub"><b>Selected design: </b>My proposal involved measuring the temperature profile of a heat sink placed on a hot plate. Twelve K-type thermocouples were calibrated
      and installed along various surfaces of the heat sink which was then heated and allowed to reach steady-state conditions, whereupon temperature data was captured and stored.
      Experimental results were then compared to results from MATLAB and ANSYS simulations.</p>
    <p class="subsub"><b>Project outcomes: </b>The experiment was conducted successfully and yielded reliable data. Simulation results were within ±5°C of experimental results.</p>

    <h3>Machine Design II Project</h3><div class="project_link"><a href="https://github.com/smcgee8894/ME465_Winch">GitHub repository</a></div>
    <p class="subsub"><b>Project objectives: </b>Design a winch system which delivers 4,000 in·lbf of torque to the drum at a speed of 30-35 rpm. The project was split into three
      sections (geartrain selection, shaft design, and bearing selection), each of which required a report with accompanying SOLIDWORKS models and calculations. A particular emphasis
      was placed on simulating a real-world design scenario: there was not a "correct design" and performance requirements were vague and conflicting, which required students to make several
      judgement calls about which aspects of performance were most critical.</p>
    <p class="subsub"><b>Selected design: </b>Our calculations indicated that delivering the required 4,000 in·lbf of torque at the lowest required speed of 30 rpm would require 1.9 hp before
      accounting for losses, exceeding the 1.2 hp output from the prescribed motor. We reasoned that the torque output requirement was more critical than the speed requirement, and
      designed the system accordingly using a larger gear ratio to produce the necessary reduction. We also iterated the design multiple times as constraints from one phase would require changes
      to a prior design decision. Since the shaft was designed prior to selecting bearings, for instance, we discovered that our shaft exceeded the maximum angular deflection requirements for all
      appropriate bearings requiring modifications to the shaft design. Our design ultimately used an 80:1 worm gear reduction, a shaft major diameter of 2.60", and flanged bronze bushings
      supporting the shaft.</p>
    <p class="subsub"><b>Project outcomes: </b>The final design meets stated requirements for torque output, factor of safety, reliability, and heat dissipation. The design only falls short of
      the aforementioned output speed, operating instead at an output speed of around 15 rpm.</p>
